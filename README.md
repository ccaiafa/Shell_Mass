# Shell_Mass
Code for Shell Mass Estimation paper "Galactic HI supershells: kinetic energies and possible origin", LA Suad, CF Caiafa, EM Arnal, S Cichowolski, Astronomy&Astrophysics, Vol. 624, Apr 2019. doi: https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833850

To generate the results reported in the paper the scripts named "Compute_Xc_Dvel_YYY.m", located at the /Scripts_paper/, folder need to be run, where X is the quadrant (3 or 4) and YYY is the Delta Velocity.

The information of previously identified shells are included in the functions "load_shells_3c_Dvel_100.m", "load_shells_3c_total.m", "load_shells_4c_Dvel_100.m" and "load_shells_4c_total.m".

Some relevant functions are included in the folder /main_functions/ such as:
